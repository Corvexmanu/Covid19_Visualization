# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Build and Test

## Installation process
To run this dashboard locally, the following software is recommended:
- Git
- Visual Studio Code IDE
- Anaconda Python 3.7

Now, go to a folder to be used as repo and open Git there and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Corvexmanu/Covid19_Visualization.git
```

## Software dependencies
A requirements.txt file is included in this repo. Please nstall dependancies as follow: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build and Test
Open App.py and run f5. It should up the dash server and then go to
